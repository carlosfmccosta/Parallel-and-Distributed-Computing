[Bot]: I'm doing well, thanks for asking! It's great to chat with you. By the way, I noticed you asked about some places earlier - Lisbon is a city in Portugal, Rome (or Rom) is a city in Italy, and Spain is a country in southwestern Europe. If you have any more questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!
